          Welcome to my digital corner! I’m a developer, learner, and contrarian passionate about building impactful web applications. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and the joy of problem-solving.

          I specialize in backend development with Django, leveraging its power to craft robust, scalable applications. Along the way, I’ve dabbled in pentesting for security insights, explored the fascinating world of machine learning, and embraced responsive frontend design with tools like Bootstrap.

          I use i3wm, urxvt, and Vim for daily usage. My workflow thrives on simplicity. But i’m no stranger to tackling complex challenges. I enjoy creating systems that are both elegant and efficient.

          And let me make this clear once and for all. I'm not your typical gen-z. Stop bullying gen-z.
